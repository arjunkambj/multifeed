          connections, scheduling, publishing, analytics, inbox, billing, and

        <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
        <h3>Information you provide</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            account and workspace information, including your name, email
            address, authentication details, organization name, and team
            membership;
          </li>
          <li>
            posts, captions, media, schedules, notes, publishing preferences,
            and support messages;
          </li>
          <li>
            subscription and transaction information. Our payment provider
            processes payment-card details; Multi Feed receives records such as
            customer, subscription, product, payment status, and transaction
            identifiers; and
          </li>
          <li>
            information you send when you contact us or request support or data
            deletion.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information collected automatically</h3>
        <p>
          We may collect device, browser, IP address, log, diagnostic, security,
          and product-usage information needed to operate, protect, and improve
          the service. We may also use essential cookies and similar storage for
          authentication, session continuity, preferences, and security.

        <h2>3. Data from connected social platforms</h2>
        <p>
          Multi Feed accesses platform data only after you choose to connect an
          account and approve the permissions shown by that platform. Depending
          on the service and permissions you approve, we may access:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            account, profile, Page, channel, or organization identifiers,
            usernames, display names, profile images, and—in the case of
            LinkedIn—the email address returned through OpenID Connect;
          </li>
          <li>
            OAuth access tokens, refresh tokens, token expiration dates, and the
            permissions you granted;
          </li>
          <li>
            content and media needed to create, upload, schedule, or publish a
            post at your direction;
          </li>
          <li>
            post, channel, engagement, comment, message, and analytics data when
            a connected feature requires it; and
          </li>
          <li>
            publishing status, platform post identifiers, errors, and delivery
            links.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These connections may include Facebook, Instagram, Threads, LinkedIn,
          TikTok, YouTube and Google APIs, and X. Multi Feed does not receive or
          store the password you use to sign in to a social platform.

        <h2>5. Google user data and Limited Use</h2>
        <p>
          Multi Feed uses Google user data only to provide or improve the
          user-facing features you request, such as connecting a YouTube
          channel, uploading videos, reading channel information, and displaying
          YouTube analytics. Multi Feed&apos;s use and transfer to any other app
          of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the{" "}
          <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">
            Google API Services User Data Policy
          </a>
          , including its Limited Use requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          People do not read Google user data unless you give affirmative
          permission for a specific support purpose, access is necessary for
          security or abuse investigation, we must comply with law, or the data
          has been aggregated and anonymized for internal operations.

        <h2>6. When we share information</h2>
        <p>We may share information only as needed with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            infrastructure, authentication, database, storage, monitoring,
            support, and payment providers acting on our behalf;
          </li>
          <li>
            social platforms when you connect an account or direct us to access
            or publish content;
          </li>
          <li>
            other authorized members of your Multi Feed workspace, based on the
            collaborative nature of the service;
          </li>
          <li>
            authorities or other parties when reasonably necessary to comply
            with law, protect rights and safety, investigate abuse, or enforce
            agreements; and
          </li>
          <li>
            a successor in a merger, financing, acquisition, reorganization, or
            sale of assets, subject to appropriate confidentiality protections.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not sell or rent personal or connected-platform data.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>7. Legal bases</h2>
        <p>
          Where applicable law requires a legal basis, we process information to
          perform our contract with you, with your consent, for our legitimate
          interests in operating and securing Multi Feed, and to comply with
          legal obligations. You may withdraw consent for future processing at
          any time, including by disconnecting an integration.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>8. Retention and deletion</h2>
        <p>
          We keep information only as long as reasonably necessary to provide
          the service and meet security, dispute-resolution, accounting, and
          legal obligations. OAuth credentials and the related connected-account
          record are deleted from Multi Feed when you disconnect that account.
          Some billing, security, and transaction records may be kept where law
          requires it or for legitimate fraud-prevention and recordkeeping
          needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          To remove an integration or request deletion of your full Multi Feed
          account and personal data, follow our{" "}
          <Link href="/policies/data-deletion">Data Deletion Instructions</Link>
          . Deleting data from Multi Feed does not automatically delete a post
          that has already been published on a third-party platform.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>9. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards. Connected
          account tokens are encrypted at rest, access is limited, and data is
          transmitted over secure connections. No online service can guarantee
          absolute security, so please protect your credentials and notify us if
          you suspect unauthorized access.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>10. International processing</h2>
        <p>
          Multi Feed and its service providers may process information in
          countries other than your own. Where required, we use appropriate
          safeguards for international transfers of personal information.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>11. Your rights and choices</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access, correct,
          export, delete, restrict, or object to the processing of your personal
          information, and to appeal or complain to a data-protection authority.
          You can disconnect social accounts in Multi Feed and revoke access in
          the relevant platform&apos;s security settings. We may verify your
          identity before completing a request.

          when required by law or when a change materially affects how we use
          previously collected data.
